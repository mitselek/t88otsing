## Headline

Operations & Process Enablement | Data Hygiene • Documentation • Lightweight Automation

## Positioning Summary (3–4 sentences)

I help fast-moving teams create just-enough structure: clean data, living documentation, and simple scripts that remove recurring friction. I specialize in turning messy spreadsheets and implicit know‑how into maintainable datasets and 1‑page SOPs. Previous scope includes campus-wide infrastructure (≈700 users) and consolidating asset & academic record systems (5000+ assets; 500+ docs/year). Bias toward pragmatic fixes that scale from 5 → 50 people without over‑engineering.

## Core Strengths

- Data cleanup & normalization (Excel / Google Sheets + ad‑hoc scripts)
- Process capture → concise SOP (interviews → distilled checklist)
- Light automation (shell / Python scripts, API glue, zapier-style flows)
- Knowledge base structuring & permission-aware organization
- Cross-functional translation (non-technical ↔ technical)
- Incremental system consolidation (small, low-risk steps)

## Select Achievements (CV-Sourced)

- Built campus LAN for Estonian Academy of Arts (≈700 users) + migrated email to Google Mail (≈90% internal email cost reduction).
- Unified asset (5000+ items) and academic document management (500+ docs/year) on Entu platform.
- Delivered OAuth.ee (Estonian ID-card & Mobile-ID auth) in production use (incl. PÖFF festival system).
- Digitized Memento books corpus → eMem database + memoriaal.ee public interface (historical preservation).
- Enabled historians to perform controlled direct MySQL queries & content creation (improved data workflow adoption).
- Introduced structured internal documentation practices at Tele2 within invoicing & complaints tooling context.

## Recent / Relevant Experience (Condensed)

| Period | Role & Org | Focus | Key Elements |
|--------|-----------|-------|--------------|
| 2010–Present | Architect / Analyst / Developer @ Entusiastid OÜ | Data platform adaptation (Entu) | DB design, integrations, UI, client-specific customization |
| 2017–2024 | Data Janitor @ Eesti Mälu Instituut | Historical data digitization | Scanning, data cleansing, multi-source reconciliation, platform publishing |
| 2009–2012 | Head of IT Dept @ Estonian Academy of Arts | Infrastructure & consolidation | Campus LAN, Google Mail migration, Entu asset/doc systems |
| 2006–2009 | Software Developer @ Tele2 Eesti AS | Internal tooling | Invoicing & complaints solutions, documentation introduction |
| 2002–2005 | Software Developer @ Ministry of Justice | Information systems | Criminal Care IS & Criminal Procedure Register (Oracle/.NET) |

## Open Source & Projects (Selection)

- Entu Webapp – Full-stack data platform interface (schools, museums, businesses).
- OAuth.ee – National digital identity auth integration (ID-card + Mobile-ID).
- eMem / memoriaal.ee – Historical record digitization & public access.
- touch-tone – C++ touch-tone signal processing (embedded/low-level focus).
- chexs – Hexagonal chess logic & visualization (cubic coordinate handling).

## Tech & Tools

- Programming: Python, JavaScript; Bash & C (advanced), basic Java/.NET familiarity.
- Data: MySQL, Oracle, MongoDB, complex Sheets (formulas + scripting).
- Process & Documentation: SOP creation, lightweight QA frameworks.
- CAD / 3D (supporting skill): Onshape (FeatureScript), Solid Edge (fast learner).
- Networking: MikroTik MTCNA (2025).

## Operating Style

- Document-as-you-go: capture decisions + repeatable steps immediately.
- 80/20 automation: implement smallest script that reliably removes a recurring manual step.
- Iterative hardening: start minimal, add validation & monitoring only when real usage demands.
- Context economy: optimize for founder/lead time; prefer async updates with crisp deltas.

## Engagement Preferences

| Aspect | Preference |
|--------|-----------|
| Initial Scope | Diagnostic + 1–2 rapid wins (data cleanup or SOP set) |
| Weekly Availability | 15–20h (immediate) |
| Timezone | GMT+2 (EU/UK overlap) |
| Work Model | Remote-first (hybrid possible within region) |
| Communication | Async-first; structured weekly recap |

## Compensation (Guidance)

| Mode | Range / Notes |
|------|---------------|
| Contract / Part-time | €40–60 / hour (scope & equity dependent) |
| Full-time (target) | €45k–65k + equity (stage-dependent) |
| Project (fixed) | Defined deliverables (e.g., dataset normalization, SOP bundle) |

(All figures as already stated in source CVs; not market survey quotes.)

## Validation Approach

1. Clarify critical decision data & current trust gaps.
2. Snapshot existing spreadsheets / tools (read-only clones).
3. Define minimal target state (fields, update cadence, ownership).
4. Execute cleanup & normalization; log reversible changes.
5. Draft 1‑page SOP; review with 1–2 stakeholders; finalize.
6. Optional: add lightweight script/automation + usage monitoring.

## Lightweight Tooling Examples (Non-exhaustive)

- Duplicate detection script for Sheets-exported CSV (shell/Python).
- Field normalization (enums, date formats) using ad-hoc transform script.
- Scheduled report generation via simple cron + script (no heavy infra).

## Education (Condensed)

- Mathematics & Computer Science studies (University of Tartu; periods 1990–2002 among mixed academic paths).
- Additional courses: UML (2005), ADO .NET (2003), Oracle9i JDBC (2003).

## Certifications

- MikroTik Certified Network Associate (2025) – Certificate ID present in CV.

## Languages

| Language | Level (CV Source) |
|----------|-------------------|
| Estonian | Working language |
| Latvian | C2 |
| English | C2 reading/writing; C1 speaking/presentation |
| Russian | B2 |

# Gitcoin Bounties Approach (Draft)

Updated: 2025-08-12

## Focus Areas (selective)

- Documentation improvement / cleanup
- Small tooling scripts / data transforms
- Issue triage & labeling quality

## Strategy

1. Start with low/medium complexity documentation or cleanup bounties to build cred.
2. Provide over-delivery via concise improvement suggestions.
3. Track measurable deltas (readability score, link fix count, etc.).

## Submission Checklist

- [ ] Cloned / synced latest
- [ ] Reproduced issue locally
- [ ] Documented environment & versions
- [ ] Clear diff summary
- [ ] Suggested follow-up (optional)

## Reputation Building

Short feedback request snippet + consistent naming conventions.

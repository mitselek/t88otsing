# Malt Profile (Draft)

Updated: 2025-08-12

Focus: Structured admin & process support bridging business and light tech.

## Positioning Statement

I help small teams reduce friction by cleaning data, setting lightweight structure, and writing concise SOPs that stick.

## Services (Outcome phrased)

- Stable, navigable file & sheet structure in 48h
- Single-page SOP that cuts onboarding clarification cycles
- Data hygiene baseline (naming, schema, duplicates pass)
- Micro quality loop (checklist + feedback snippet)

## Engagement Models

| Model               | Scope                       | Price Placeholder |
| ------------------- | --------------------------- | ----------------- |
| Starter Diagnostic  | 0.5d audit + recommendation | €XXX              |
| Data Hygiene Sprint | 2d focused cleanup          | €XXX              |
| SOP Pack            | 2–3 SOPs + coaching         | €XXX              |
| Ongoing Support     | 2d / week                   | €XXX / month      |

## Proof Assets TODO

- [ ] Before/after sheet snapshot (anonymized)
- [ ] SOP sample (redacted)
- [ ] Short Loom explanation (optional)

## Metrics to Capture Early

- Time to onboard new person (baseline → after)
- Error count / duplicate rows before vs after
- Number of recurring clarification pings

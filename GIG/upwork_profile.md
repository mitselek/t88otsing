# Upwork Profile (Draft)

Last updated: 2025-08-12

## Elevator Pitch (≤ 300 chars)

Detail-focused process & admin support with a technical backbone: I clean data, document workflows, and keep small teams unblocked by solving light Excel / tooling issues fast.

## Value Proposition (4 bullets)

- Hybrid admin + light technical support (Excel, data cleanup, file structure)
- Creates reusable micro-documentation to cut onboarding time
- High reliability: commit → deliver, proactive progress notes
- Improves quality via simple QA checklists (low overhead)

## Core Services

1. Data cleanup & normalization (Sheets / Excel)
2. Process documentation (SOP 1–3 pages, quick start guides)
3. Light tech support (formatting, printer/file issues, basic automations)
4. Inventory / data reconciliation (manual + structured log)

## Skill Tags

Data Entry, SOP Writing, Process Documentation, Excel, Google Sheets, Quality Assurance, Virtual Assistant, Workflow Optimization, Knowledge Base

## Differentiators

| Pain               | Typical Issue        | My Approach                               | Result                  |
| ------------------ | -------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Messy sheet        | Inconsistent columns | Profile schema + batch cleanup            | Fewer downstream errors |

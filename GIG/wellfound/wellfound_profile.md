# Wellfound Profile (Draft)

Last updated: 2025-08-13

## Headline

Operations & Process Support for Growing Teams | Data Hygiene + Documentation + Light Automation

## Bio (3-4 sentences)

I help fast-moving startups maintain operational clarity without slowing down. My sweet spot: cleaning messy data, documenting informal processes into reusable guides, and building lightweight automation that scales with your team. I thrive in the "we need this fixed yesterday but done right" startup pace.

## What I'm looking for

- Operations support roles (part-time or contract initially)
- Process documentation and data cleanup projects
- Early-stage companies where systems are growing faster than documentation
- Remote-first or hybrid teams in EU timezones (GMT+2)

## Core Value Propositions

- **Quick operational wins**: Turn chaotic spreadsheets into clean, searchable datasets in 24-48h
- **Knowledge capture**: Transform tribal knowledge into 1-page SOPs that new team members can actually follow
- **Scale-ready systems**: Build lightweight processes that work at 10 people and still work at 50
- **Low-friction integration**: Jump in, assess quickly, deliver without requiring extensive onboarding

## Skills & Tools

**Data & Process**: Excel/Sheets mastery, data normalization, process mapping, SOP creation
**Technical**: Basic automation (scripts, zapier-style workflows), API integrations, light Python
**Operational**: Quality assurance frameworks, inventory management, documentation systems
**Communication**: Technical writing, stakeholder updates, cross-functional collaboration

## What Sets Me Apart

| Common Startup Pain                                         | My Approach                                                                             | Outcome                                                  |
| ----------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| "Our data is a mess but we need insights now"               | Rapid triage → clean core dataset → document maintenance process                        | Decisions based on clean data, sustainable going forward |
| "New hires keep asking the same questions"                  | Interview 2-3 team members → distill into quick-start guide → iterate based on feedback | Faster onboarding, less founder/lead interruption        |
| "We're doing this manually but don't have time to automate" | Identify highest-impact 80/20 automation → build simple script → document for team      | Time savings without over-engineering                    |

## Experience Focus

- Operations support in fast-moving environments
- Data quality and process standardization
- Cross-functional documentation that actually gets used
- Bridging business needs with technical implementation

## What I'm NOT

- Full-stack developer (but I can write scripts and understand tech debt)
- Marketing specialist (but I can organize campaign data and document workflows)
- Product manager (but I can document requirements and map user flows)

## Working Style

- **Startup-aligned**: Bias toward action, comfortable with ambiguity, focused on business impact
- **Documentation-first**: Everything gets documented so knowledge doesn't live in one person's head
- **Iteration-friendly**: Start with MVP process, improve based on real usage patterns
- **Remote-optimized**: Clear communication, proactive updates, timezone-aware collaboration

## Compensation Expectations

- **Contract/Part-time**: €40-60/hour depending on scope and equity component
- **Full-time**: €45k-65k + equity (negotiable based on stage and equity %)
- **Project-based**: Fixed-price for defined deliverables (data cleanup, process documentation)

## Availability

- Immediate: 15-20h/week contract work
- Q4 2025: Open to full-time opportunities with right startup
- Timezone: GMT+2 (Estonia), overlap with EU/UK business hours

## Portfolio Highlights (Coming Soon)

- Data cleanup case study: 80% reduction in duplicate customer records
- Process documentation: New team member onboarding time cut from 2 weeks to 3 days
- Light automation: Manual weekly report generation → automated with 1-click updates

## Why Startups?

I'm energized by the "figure it out as we go" environment where every process improvement has immediate, visible impact. Large companies have their place, but I prefer environments where you can see the direct connection between operational improvements and business growth.

## Questions I Ask Before Starting

1. What's the biggest operational pain point slowing down your team right now?
2. Which processes do people complain about most?
3. What data do you need for decisions but currently can't trust?
4. Where does knowledge currently live only in someone's head?

## Next Steps

- Interested in a quick 20-minute call to discuss operational pain points
- Can provide a sample process audit for free (1-2 hour scope)
- References available from previous operational improvement projects

# Braintrust Profile (Draft)

Updated: 2025-08-12

Focus: Hybrid operations + light technical problem solving.

## Positioning

I stabilize small remote teams by cleaning their operational data, documenting repeatable workflows, and removing low-level blockers.

## Target Engagements

- Part-time operations & documentation support
- Data cleanliness & lightweight QA loop
- Transition support (handover documentation)

## Impact Angles

| Area           | Friction              | Intervention          | Benefit         |
| -------------- | --------------------- | --------------------- | --------------- |
| Data hygiene   | Duplicates / mismatch | Schema + cleanup pass | Fewer errors    |
| Onboarding     | Knowledge in heads    | SOP + quick starts    | Faster ramp     |
| Minor blockers | Tooling quirks        | Rapid triage          | More focus time |

## Early Metrics to Prove

Ramp time, error rates, clarification pings.

## TODO

- [ ] Add anonymized mini case
- [ ] Define rate card (USD) aligned to market

## Decision Matrix

| Scenario | Recommended Action |
|----------|-------------------|
| **No budget, need quick credential** | Phase 1 only (Google + PMI + Scrum.org) |
| **<€500 budget, 3 months available** | Phase 1 + IBM Certificate |
| **Interview for senior PM role** | Phase 1 + Cambridge program |
| **Manufacturing pivot confirmed** | Phase 1 + MIT Supply Chain (long-term) |
| **After landing job** | CAPM + PSM I certifications |

---

## Next Steps (Priority Order)

1. ⚡ **TODAY:** Complete PMI Kickoff (45 min)
2. 🔥 **TONIGHT:** Sign up for Google PM Certificate free trial
3. 📅 **Next 7 days:** Google PM Course 1 sprint (5-8 hrs/day)
4. 📚 **Ongoing:** Scrum.org learning paths (2-3 hrs/week)
5. 💼 **Update CV/LinkedIn** after each completion
6. 📞 **Next week:** Contact Töötukassa about funding options
7. 🎯 **Monitor:** Job applications - if no interviews after Phase 1, consider Phase 2

---

## Risk Mitigation

**Risk:** Google certificate doesn't lead to interviews  
**Mitigation:** Pursue IBM certificate (€370) or CAPM (€400)

**Risk:** Budget becomes available but uncertain which program  
**Mitigation:** Default to Cambridge (best prestige/time ratio)

**Risk:** Manufacturing pivot fails to materialize  
**Mitigation:** MIT Supply Chain still valuable for operations/logistics PM roles

**Risk:** Burnout from intensive study while job hunting  
**Mitigation:** Phase 1 is only 2 weeks; pause between phases if needed

---

## Success Metrics

**Phase 1 (2 weeks):**
- ✅ PMI Kickoff badge obtained
- ✅ Google PM Course 1 certificate
- ✅ Scrum.org materials studied
- ✅ CV/LinkedIn updated with new credentials

**Phase 2 (if pursued):**
- ✅ Cambridge or IBM certificate completed
- ✅ 3+ job interviews mentioning new credentials
- ✅ Confidence increase in PM methodology discussions

**Phase 3 (after job secured):**
- ✅ CAPM certification obtained
- ✅ PSM I or PSPO I certification
- ✅ Salary increase or promotion achieved

---

## Final Recommendation

**START TODAY with Phase 1 (FREE).** 

The Google PM Certificate + PMI Kickoff + Scrum.org combination provides:
- Immediate CV enhancement (within 2 weeks)
- Zero cost if completed within free trial
- Foundational knowledge for all PM roles
- Strong talking points for interviews

**Only pursue paid options (Cambridge/IBM/MIT) if:**
1. Phase 1 doesn't lead to interviews within 1-2 months, OR
2. You land interview where credential could be decisive, OR
3. Budget becomes available and you want faster results

**The free options are surprisingly strong.** Many Estonian IT companies value practical experience + initiative (self-study) more than expensive credentials. The Google certificate + Scrum knowledge may be sufficient to get interviews, where your 20+ years experience will carry the weight.

**Status:** Ready to execute Phase 1 immediately  
**Next review:** After Phase 1 completion (2 weeks)  
**Budget required:** €0 (Phase 1), €400-1,500 (Phase 2 if needed)

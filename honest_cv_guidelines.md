# Honest CV Guidelines

## ⚠️ CRITICAL QUALITY CONTROL

**See detailed violation log**: `cross_reference_violations_log.md` for comprehensive audit results.

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENT**: Always perform systematic cross-referencing against master CV templates before ANY application submission. AI assistants systematically fabricate content when not properly constrained.

## Core Principles

### 1. Accurate Representation

- Never claim expertise in areas where you only have basic or tangential experience
- Distinguish between actual skills and transferable skills
- Be transparent about the scope and depth of your experience

### 2. Proper Categorization

- Group skills and training by their actual subject matter, not aspirational categories
- Don't inflate general IT skills as specialized domain expertise
- Use honest section headings that reflect reality

### 3. Transferable Skills Approach

- Frame relevant experience as "transferable skills" rather than domain expertise
- Clearly position yourself as someone willing to learn, not someone who already knows everything
- Show how your existing skills can apply to new domains without overstating

## Common Exaggerations to Avoid

### ❌ Don't Do

- "Kompetentsid [valdkonna] valdkonnas" when you don't have actual experience in that field
- "Erialane täiendkoolitus [spetsiifilises valdkonnas]" when including unrelated courses
- Claiming project experience that doesn't actually relate to the target domain
- Using technical jargon to make basic experience sound more advanced

### ✅ Do Instead

- "Ülekantavad oskused" - honest about what transfers from your experience
- Separate training by actual subject matter with honest subsections
- Focus on demonstrable skills and concrete achievements
- Use clear, accurate descriptions of your actual experience

## Section Structure Guidelines

### Training/Education

```markdown
### Erialane täiendkoolitus

#### [Actual Domain 1]

- Course 1 actually related to this domain
- Course 2 actually related to this domain

#### [Actual Domain 2] 

- Course 3 actually related to this different domain
```

### Skills

```markdown
### Ülekantavad oskused

- Frame as skills that can transfer to new domain
- Be honest about depth of experience
- Show learning ability and adaptability
```

### Projects

- Only highlight projects that genuinely relate to the target domain
- If adapting a project description, be honest about the actual scope
- Don't stretch technical details beyond reality

### Chronological Ordering

- **Always order all listings by most recent first** (reverse chronological)
- Apply this to: work experience, education, training, projects, achievements
- Use consistent date formatting (YYYY-MM or YYYY for clarity)
- This helps employers quickly see your current capabilities and recent experience

## Why This Matters

1. **Interview Safety**: You can confidently discuss everything on your CV
2. **Professional Integrity**: Shows you understand the difference between experience and potential
3. **Credibility**: Demonstrates self-awareness and honesty
4. **Better Fit**: Helps employers understand what you actually bring vs. what you need to learn

## Government/Defense Positions

Extra considerations for security-sensitive roles:

- Absolute accuracy is crucial - any misrepresentation could disqualify you
- Show willingness to learn rather than claiming expertise you don't have
- Demonstrate integrity through honest self-presentation
- Focus on genuine transferable skills and learning capability

## Source Materials and Quality Control

### Master CV Templates

Dear Hiring Team,

I am writing to express my strong interest in Mechatronics Engineer positions, particularly those focused on precision instrumentation and the automation of biological systems. I am drawn to the challenges of developing and integrating complex electromechanical systems, and I am eager to apply my skills in areas such as 3D prototyping, microcontroller programming, and low-pressure pneumatics.

With over 25 years of experience in IT and software development, I have built a solid foundation in problem-solving, systems integration, and data management. My hands-on, scientific curiosity began in my youth, working with fed-batch fermenters and cultivating *E. coli*. This early experience gave me a deep appreciation for the interplay between hardware and software and honed my troubleshooting abilities. For example, I developed a script to automate data collection and feeding control, resulting in a tenfold increase in biomass generation. This practical experience, combined with my IT background, has prepared me well for the integration challenges of mechatronics engineering.

I am confident that my diverse skill set makes me a strong candidate for roles involving sensorics and innovative system development. I am eager to contribute to a team that is developing cutting-edge solutions.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I have attached my resume for your review and welcome the opportunity to discuss my qualifications further in an interview.

Sincerely,  
Mihkel Putrinš

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my sincere interest in the Senior Software Engineer position for your billing system team.

As a software developer with over thirty years of experience in creating and optimizing complex systems, I possess extensive knowledge of various programming technologies and architectures that align perfectly with your requirements. My strong background in backend development, databases, and system optimization makes me an ideal candidate for maintaining and evolving your billing infrastructure.

At the Estonian Academy of Arts, I led a comprehensive Google Apps migration project, creating custom integrations and scripts that significantly improved the institution's IT infrastructure efficiency while reducing overhead costs by approximately 50%. As a co-founder of Entu, I developed a scalable data platform involving complex database optimization and caching strategies to manage increasing traffic demands - skills that would transfer well to your billing system environment.

Notably, I also worked directly in the billing department at Tele2 from October 2006 to June 2009, where I gained invaluable first-hand experience with telecommunications billing systems, customer data management, and revenue operations. This experience gives me unique insights into the critical nature of billing infrastructure and the business implications of system performance and reliability.

My technical expertise includes:
- Strong backend development experience (including Java-based systems)
- Extensive work with relational and NoSQL databases, including optimization techniques
- Implementation of microservices architecture
- Experience with Docker containerization and CI/CD pipelines
- REST/SOAP API integration and development
- Version control with Git and automated testing frameworks
- Application of AI tools to enhance productivity and code quality

I thrive in Agile environments and am accustomed to the full software development lifecycle. My strengths include solving complex problems, designing robust system architecture, optimizing code performance, and developing high-throughput applications. I work effectively both independently and collaboratively, with experience leading development teams that would benefit your self-organized Agile team structure.

I am particularly excited about the opportunity to work on billing systems that require both technical excellence and careful attention to performance optimization. I welcome the challenge of maintaining on-premise infrastructure while integrating with cloud providers, and am eager to embrace the DevOps culture you've described.

I have attached my CV with a more detailed overview of my projects and technical experience. I would welcome the opportunity to demonstrate my technical abilities and discuss how my experience can add value to your development team.

Thank you for your consideration, and I look forward to the possibility of discussing my application further.

Sincerely,

Mihkel Putrinš

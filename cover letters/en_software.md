# Hey

I've been building software for over 25 years, specializing in backend systems and architecture. At the Estonian Academy of Arts, I led the Google Apps migration, streamlining communication and collaboration for the entire institution and slashing IT overhead by an estimated half.

Co-founding Entu gave me hands-on experience scaling data platforms to handle increasing user traffic and data volume. This involved optimizing database performance and implementing caching strategies. I'm proficient in Python, Node.js, MySQL, and familiar with AWS cloud services. I also leverage AI agents in my daily development workflow to boost productivity and improve the quality of my code.

Keen to discuss how my experience in backend development and system architecture can contribute to your company's continued success.

Best,
Mihkel Putrin≈°

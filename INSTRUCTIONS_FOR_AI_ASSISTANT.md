```text
.ai_docs/
├── cross_reference_violations_log.md    # Detailed audit of 9 AI fabrications found
├── honest_cv_guidelines.md              # Comprehensive truthfulness guidelines  
├── motivation_letters_audit_log.md      # Specific letter audit findings
└── technical_notes.md                   # Technical documentation & workarounds
```

**Usage:**

- **MANDATORY:** Check these files before creating ANY application materials
- Contains detailed examples of past AI fabrications to avoid
- Provides specific guidelines for honest content creation

## 🚀 NEW JOB APPLICATION WORKFLOW

### When User Reports New Job Opportunities

**Standard workflow for "I found a new job offer: [URLs]"**

1. **Fetch and analyze** job posting content from provided URLs
2. **Create application folder structure** following established pattern:

   ```text
   applications/CompanyName/
   ├── readme.md           # Job analysis and application strategy
   ├── tookuulutus.md      # Original job posting (Estonian)
   ├── cv.md               # (create when requested)
   ├── kaaskiri.md         # (create when requested)
   └── communication/      # Directory for correspondence
   ```

3. **Immediate deliverables** (without asking):
   - **Company folder** under `applications/`
   - **readme.md** with comprehensive job analysis including:
     - Company background and requirements

Hello Cliff and Sahlie,

I hope you're both doing well. It's been over a year since we last spoke, and I wanted to reach out because the AI revolution has fundamentally changed my relationship with software development.

I'm still deeply engaged in 3D modeling and parametric design, but AI has eliminated so many of the friction points that previously made coding feel tedious to me. What I'm loving now is that I can focus on the interesting parts - testing edge cases, writing clear documentation, and thoughtful refactoring - while AI handles the repetitive boilerplate. It's like having a brilliant junior developer who never gets tired of writing the obvious code.

This shift has reignited my enthusiasm for building software products. When I declined your original offer, mobile web development felt like it would pull me away from the 3D work I'm passionate about. Now I'm realizing that AI-assisted development might actually complement my spatial thinking and design sensibilities rather than compete with them.

I'm curious - how has AI changed Speechify's development workflow? Given your focus on accessibility and your technical team's caliber, I imagine you're doing fascinating work with AI tooling.

If you're still building that rapid prototyping team for mobile web products, I'd love to explore whether there might be a fit now. My perspective has evolved considerably, and I think I could bring a unique combination of spatial reasoning, user experience intuition, and now AI-enhanced development velocity.

Best regards,

## Why This Rewrite Works

### Narrative Arc

1. **Acknowledgment** - References the time gap and previous conversation
2. **Evolution** - Shows genuine change in perspective, not just opportunism  
3. **Specific insight** - Demonstrates understanding of AI's impact on development
4. **Connection** - Links his 3D background to potential value in their context
5. **Curiosity** - Shows genuine interest in their work, not just the opportunity
6. **Soft ask** - Leaves room for them to respond without pressure

### Authentic Elements

- **Honest about change** - Admits his perspective evolved rather than pretending he was always interested
- **Specific benefits** - Names exactly what AI enables (testing, documentation, refactoring)
- **Personal insight** - "brilliant junior developer" metaphor shows real experience with AI tools
- **Unique positioning** - Spatial thinking + UX intuition + AI-enhanced development

### Strategic Improvements

- **Question about their work** - Shows genuine interest, not just self-promotion
- **Value proposition** - Suggests how his background could be uniquely valuable
- **Professional tone** - More polished while maintaining authenticity
- **Clear next step** - Invites dialogue without being pushy

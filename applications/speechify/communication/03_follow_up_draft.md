Hello,

I'm still going strong in 3D modeling, but advent of AI has awakened my interest for coding - number of tedious and repetitive tasks in a field is getting less by day and I'm loving, that I can now pay attention to testing and documentation and routine refactoring as all these were quite expensive and are no more :)

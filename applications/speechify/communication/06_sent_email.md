Hello,

I'm still going strong in 3D modeling, but AI has awakened my interest for coding - tedious tasks are getting less by day and I can now focus on testing, documentation and refactoring.

Impressive growth to 50M+ users and the API ecosystem you've built. Estonian language support particularly caught my attention :).

If you're still building that mobile web team, I'd be curious to explore it now. My perspective on development has shifted considerably.

Best,

Mihkel

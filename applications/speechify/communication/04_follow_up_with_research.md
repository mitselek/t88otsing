Hello Cliff and Sahlie,

I hope you're both doing well. It's been over a year since we last spoke, and I wanted to reach out because the AI revolution has fundamentally changed my relationship with software development.

I'm still deeply engaged in 3D modeling and parametric design, but AI has eliminated so many of the friction points that previously made coding feel tedious to me. What I'm loving now is that I can focus on the interesting parts - testing edge cases, writing clear documentation, and thoughtful refactoring - while AI handles the repetitive boilerplate. It's like having a brilliant junior developer who never gets tired of writing the obvious code.

This shift has reignited my enthusiasm for building software products. When I declined your original offer, mobile web development felt like it would pull me away from the 3D work I'm passionate about. Now I'm realizing that AI-assisted development might actually complement my spatial thinking and design sensibilities rather than compete with them.

Looking at where Speechify has evolved since we last spoke - the expansion to 50+ million users, Speechify Studio for creators, the voice cloning capabilities, and especially your API offering - it's impressive how you've built an entire ecosystem around accessibility technology. The fact that you're now working with school districts globally and have celebrity voices like Snoop and Gwyneth shows the platform's incredible reach and impact.

What particularly caught my attention is your API and the developer ecosystem you're building. Given my background in system integrations and the fact that I now find AI-assisted development genuinely exciting, I'm curious about the technical challenges your team faces in scaling speech AI to this level. The combination of instant voice cloning, multilingual support (I noticed Estonian is supported!), and real-time processing must create fascinating engineering problems.

If you're still building that rapid prototyping team for mobile web products, I'd love to explore whether there might be a fit now. My perspective has evolved considerably, and I think I could bring a unique combination of spatial reasoning, user experience intuition, and now AI-enhanced development velocity - especially for products that bridge the physical and digital worlds.

Best regards,

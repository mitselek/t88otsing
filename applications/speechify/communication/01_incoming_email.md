Hey Mihkel, I was blown away by your work online after coming across your github and wanted to reach out. The fact that you made 2,002 contributions in 2023 is super impressive and we've been looking to partner with more people in Estonia so this is a really good fit.

As a quick background, I'm the CEO of Speechify, we are the largest supplier of Speech AI in the world with over 25 million users. I first built speechify to help overcome my dyslexia when I was in university. I'm building a team inside our company to stand up really fast mobile web products and think you'd be a really good fit. Can learn more here. For more background, Speechify has been the #1 app in it's app store category on the apple app store for 4.5 yrs and one of the fastest growing extensions in the history of the chrome store. I built about 36 products when I was in University and did 42 hackathons. One product I built was a text to speech tool that made it really easy for my iPhone and laptop to read things out to me. Today, Speechify has more than 25 million usersâ€” mostly people like me who have dyslexia, adhd, low vision, autism, concussions, anxiety, or who are second language learners.

After finishing his Undergrad in Mathematics at Stanford and and his Masters in AI at Stanford in 2020 my brother Tyler joined Speechify to lead our AI team. Tyler put together a huge cluster of H100 GPUs that we trained 8 years of audio data on to create our 7 foundational speech models; as a result, we ended up becoming the largest SpeechAI provider in the world and one of the top 30 fastest growing AI companies in the world.

I think you'd thrive at Speechify and be an amazing teammate with us. Our core principals are extreme product quality, speed, and leading with love. We look for people who can learn quickly, are able to ship features fast, can move metrics, have fire in the belly for the product, and high loyalty to the team. We work asynchronously and remote first so you can work whenever you want, wherever you want, with a very flexible atmosphere. Happy to work together for 10-20 hours a week initially to start. Most of the teammates at Speechify were CEO, CTO, or an engineering leader at their previous company so our technical bar is very high. Could you be free for a quick call to get to know you Thursday this coming week? Or better yet, if you "reply all" here Sahalie (CCed) can share with you the Speechify technical challenge we give to candidates we think most highly of. What is the technical stack you feel most comfortable with?

All my best,  
Cliff

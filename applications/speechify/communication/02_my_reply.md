Dear Cliff, Sahlile

Thank you very much for your message - I'm genuinely touched by your interest and impressed by the impactful work your team is doing.

However, I want to be upfront with you. While I appreciate your recognition of my GitHub contributions, a significant portion of my work revolves around musical scores and none around mobile web products. Additionally, I'm currently facing personal challenges that have led me to reevaluate my career path. My true passion lies in parametric 3D modeling and prototyping, particularly in fields like aerodynamics and engineering.

Given my current circumstances and interests, I fear that I may not be the best fit for the role at Speechify. However, I'm grateful for your consideration.

If you have any opportunities or connections within the realm of parametric 3D modeling and prototyping, particularly in aerodynamics or related fields, I would be keen to explore them further.

Thank you once again for reaching out, and I wish you and your team continued success in your endeavors.

Best regards,

Mihkel

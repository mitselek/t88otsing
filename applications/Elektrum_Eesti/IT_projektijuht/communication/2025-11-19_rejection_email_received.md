## Analysis

### What Went Well

✅ **Made it to second round** - Passed initial screening, first interview, homework assignment  
✅ **Homework quality** - Got positive feedback, invited to second interview  
✅ **Communication strategy** - Professional thank-you email same day, strategic follow-up with value arguments  
✅ **Rapport building** - Established "sina" form with Gerli, comfortable conversation tone  
✅ **Timing of follow-ups** - Both thank-you and follow-up sent at appropriate times

### Possible Improvement Areas

🤔 **Limited IT project management experience** - Despite strong homework, may have lacked depth in PM-specific scenarios  
🤔 **Energy sector experience** - Competitor may have had domain expertise in utilities/energy  
🤔 **Team leadership track record** - Role likely required proven history of leading development teams  
🤔 **Technical depth vs. breadth** - May have appeared more as generalist than specialist PM

### Strategic Insights

**Profile mismatch noted:** "profiil vastas kõige enam antud rolli vajadustele" suggests specific gap:

- Likely: **direct IT project management experience in enterprise environment**
- Possible: **formal PM certification (PMP, PRINCE2, Agile/Scrum Master)**
- Possible: **larger-scale project portfolio** (multi-team, multi-year initiatives)
- Possible: **stakeholder management in regulated industry** (energy sector has compliance/regulatory complexity)

**Competitive positioning:**

- "mitmeid tugevaid kandidaate" confirms suspicion: market is competitive for PM roles
- Getting to second round = strong technical/communication skills validated
- Not selected = profile mismatch, not lack of quality

---

## Lessons Learned

### For Future Applications

1. **Emphasize direct PM experience earlier** - Lead with PM-specific accomplishments in CV/cover letter
2. **Quantify project scale** - Add metrics: budget size, team size, project duration, stakeholders managed
3. **Domain expertise matters** - Consider targeting roles where teaching/mechatronics background adds value (EdTech, manufacturing automation)
4. **Certifications may be gatekeepers** - Investigate if formal PM certification (Scrum Master, PMP) would strengthen positioning
5. **Follow-up strategy worked** - Got timely response after strategic follow-up; repeat this pattern

### Positive Takeaways

- ✅ Homework quality was sufficient to advance → technical skills are competitive
- ✅ Communication strategy was professional → no burned bridges
- ✅ Made it through multiple rounds → profile is viable for PM roles
- ✅ Rapid response to follow-up → they took candidacy seriously

## Next Steps

- [ ] Send brief thank-you reply to Diana (maintain positive relationship for future opportunities)
- [ ] Request feedback (optional, low expectation of response but worth trying)
- [ ] Update application tracking: status = **Rejected** after second interview
- [ ] Analyze other active applications (Enefit, RIK, etc.)
- [ ] Consider: Add PM-specific certifications to development plan (Scrum Master, PMP)
- [ ] Review CV to emphasize measurable PM achievements (if any exist from past roles)

## Reflection

**Emotional check:** Disappointment is natural after investing significant time (homework, 2 interviews, follow-ups). Allow processing time.

**Reality check:** Made it to final round against "mitmeid tugevaid kandidaate" - this is strong validation of skills and fit. The gap was narrow, not wide.

**Forward focus:** This outcome clarifies what to emphasize in future applications: quantifiable PM experience, domain expertise alignment, and formal certifications if pursuing PM track seriously.

**Relationship preservation:** Elektrum remains a good company. Maintaining positive relationship opens door for future opportunities.

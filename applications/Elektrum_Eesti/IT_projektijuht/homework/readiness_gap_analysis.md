# Project Launch Readiness - Gap Analysis

Last updated: 2025-10-24T15:31:18+03:00

**Context**: This homework submission provides strategic planning and process documentation for an 8-week promo code system implementation.

**Question**: "If this was a real project - could we launch it from this submission?"

---

## Executive Summary

**Short answer**: No, not immediately. This submission provides **strategic foundation and process framework** but lacks the **tactical details** needed for immediate execution.

**What we have**:

- Strategic planning (sprints, phases, roles)
- Process definitions (workflows, ceremonies, governance)
- Quality framework (metrics, monitoring, RACI)

**What's missing for launch**:

- Technical specifications (API contracts, database schemas)
- User stories with acceptance criteria
- Environment setup and infrastructure details
- Vendor/partner contracts and SLAs
- Actual team members assigned

## Gap Analysis by Category

### 1. Requirements & User Stories (80% Ready)

**What we have**:

- High-level feature breakdown (4 sprints)
- Business problem analysis (Section 8 edge cases)
- Clear success criteria and metrics

**Gaps**:

- Detailed user stories with acceptance criteria (estimated 40-60 stories needed)
- Technical acceptance criteria (API response formats, error codes)
- Non-functional requirements (performance SLAs, security requirements)

**Time to close**: 2-3 weeks (requirements workshop + refinement sessions)

---

### 2. Technical Architecture (30% Ready)

**What we have**:

- Integration points identified (CC&B, Portal, Mobile)
- High-level data flow understanding
- Security considerations (role-based access, GDPR)

**Gaps**:

- API contract specifications (endpoints, request/response schemas)
- Database schema design (tables, relationships, indexes)

**Time to close**: 3-4 weeks (technical design phase with architecture team)

---

### 3. Team & Resources (40% Ready)

**What we have**:

- Team structure defined (8.5 FTE breakdown)

- Blue-green deployment strategy mentioned

**Gaps**:

- Development environment setup (sandboxes for each team)
- CI/CD pipeline configuration
- Version control repository structure
- Code branching strategy

**Time to close**: 2-4 weeks (DevOps setup + validation)

---

### 5. Governance & Stakeholder Alignment (70% Ready)

**What we have**:

- Clear governance structure (Steering Committee)
- Escalation procedures
- Communication plan (Weekly/Monthly reporting)
- Risk management approach

**Gaps**:

- Steering Committee members actually appointed
- Budget formally approved

**Time to close**: 1-2 weeks (governance formalization)

---

### 6. Compliance & Legal (20% Ready)

**What we have**:

- GDPR considerations identified
- 7-year audit log retention mentioned
- Data privacy awareness

**Gaps**:

- Legal review of promo code terms & conditions
- GDPR impact assessment completed
- Data processing agreements (if third parties involved)
- Accounting/tax implications of discounts (finance review)
- Compliance with consumer protection regulations

**Time to close**: 3-6 weeks (legal/compliance review cycle)

---

### 7. Testing & Quality Assurance (60% Ready)

**What we have**:

- UAT process defined
- Test case design approach
- Bug triage procedures
- Quality metrics defined

**Gaps**:

- Actual test cases written (integration, UAT, regression)
- Test data prepared
- QA environment validated
- Performance testing plan
- Security testing/penetration testing scheduled

**Time to close**: 2-3 weeks (concurrent with development)

## Launch Readiness Timeline

If this homework was approved today (October 24, 2025):

| Phase                     | Duration  | Activities                                                                    |
| ------------------------- | --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Project Initiation**    | 2 weeks   | Governance formalization, team assignment, budget approval, kickoff           |
| **Requirements & Design** | 3-4 weeks | User story workshops, technical design, API contracts, database schema        |
| **Environment Setup**     | 3 weeks   | DevOps infrastructure, CI/CD pipeline, test environments (parallel to design) |
| **Legal/Compliance**      | 4-6 weeks | GDPR assessment, legal review (parallel to design/development)                |
| **Sprint 1-4 Execution**  | 8 weeks   | Development, testing, deployment (as planned)                                 |

## What This Submission Demonstrates

### Strengths

1. **Strategic thinking**: Right-sized processes for 8-week project scope
2. **Process maturity**: Comprehensive but not over-engineered approach
3. **Risk awareness**: Identified dependencies, edge cases, governance needs
4. **Agile fluency**: Proper sprint planning, ceremonies, metrics
5. **Stakeholder management**: Clear communication and escalation paths
6. **Quality focus**: Defined metrics, monitoring, testing approach

### Realistic Expectations

This homework shows:

- Understanding that planning ≠ execution readiness
- Recognition of companion documents as learning materials (not project artifacts)
- Transparency about scope limitations (8 weeks, not quarterly/annual)
- Practical judgment in right-sizing documentation

## Answer to "Could We Launch?"

**For a homework evaluation**: This submission is **excellent** - demonstrates strategic planning, process design, and IT PM competencies.

**For a real project launch**: This provides the **foundation**, but you'd need:

1. **Immediate (Week 0-2)**:

   - Project charter and budget approval
   - Actual team members assigned
   - Kickoff meeting scheduled

2. **Short-term (Week 2-6)**:

   - Detailed user stories (40-60 stories)
   - Technical design (API contracts, DB schema)
   - Development environments ready
   - Legal/compliance review initiated

3. **Before Sprint 1 (Week 6-8)**:
   - All technical spikes completed
   - Sprint 1 backlog refined and estimated
   - Team onboarded and trained
   - Definition of Done finalized

**Bottom line**: This homework provides the **roadmap and rulebook**. To actually launch, you need the **resources, approvals, and detailed specifications**.

## Recommended Response

**If asked this question in interview**:

> "This submission provides the strategic framework and process foundation for the project. It demonstrates how I would approach planning, team structure, and governance.
>
> However, to actually launch, we'd need 6-8 weeks of preparation:
>
> - Detailed user stories and technical design
> - Team members assigned and environments provisioned
> - Legal/compliance reviews completed
> - Budget formally approved
>
> The homework shows my planning and process design capabilities. The missing tactical details would emerge through workshops with your actual teams, technical architects, and stakeholders - something I couldn't do without insider knowledge of Elektrum's systems and constraints.
>
> I intentionally kept the documentation focused on what I could credibly design from the outside, rather than making assumptions about your internal architecture, team availability, or technical capabilities."

**This positions you as**:

- Realistic about scope limitations
- Understanding the difference between planning and execution
- Respectful of internal knowledge you don't have
- Capable of strategic thinking while acknowledging tactical gaps

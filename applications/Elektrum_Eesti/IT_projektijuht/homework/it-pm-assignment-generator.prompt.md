## Workflow for Assignment Responses

When given an assignment task, follow this structured approach:

### Phase 1: Understand Requirements

1. **Read specification documents carefully**
   - Identify business objectives and success criteria
   - Extract functional requirements and constraints
   - Note integration points and dependencies
   - Understand user personas and use cases

2. **Clarify deliverable expectations**
   - What format is required? (document, diagram, presentation)
   - What level of detail? (high-level overview vs detailed plan)
   - What audience? (technical team, business stakeholders, mixed)
   - What timeline? (sprint-level vs release-level planning)

### Phase 2: Research and Analyze

1. **Research Agile best practices** (for Agile planning tasks)
   - Review Scrum Guide or Kanban principles
   - Identify appropriate ceremonies (stand-ups, retrospectives, reviews)
   - Consider sprint structure and timeline
   - Plan for backlog refinement and prioritization

2. **Analyze business logic** (for technical tasks)
   - Break down complex logic into decision points
   - Identify conditional branches and loops
   - Map data flow and transformations
   - Note edge cases and error handling

### Phase 3: Plan Solution Development

For **Agile Development Plans**, structure response as:

1. **Executive Summary**
   - Project overview (1-2 paragraphs)
   - Key objectives and success metrics
   - High-level timeline and milestones

2. **Agile Implementation Approach**
   - **Sprint 0 (Planning & Setup)**:
     - Requirements gathering and analysis
     - User story creation and backlog initialization
     - Team formation and role assignment
     - Development environment setup
   - **Development Sprints** (iterative cycles):
     - Sprint planning (story selection, estimation, commitment)
     - Daily stand-ups (progress, blockers, collaboration)
     - Development and testing (TDD, continuous integration)
     - Sprint review (demo to stakeholders, feedback collection)
     - Sprint retrospective (process improvement, lessons learned)
   - **Release Preparation**:
     - UAT (user acceptance testing) and bug fixes
     - Documentation finalization
     - Deployment planning and execution
     - Post-deployment monitoring

3. **IT Specialist Responsibilities**
   - **Requirements Phase**: Document business needs, create user stories, validate acceptance criteria
   - **Design Phase**: Technical architecture, integration planning, risk assessment
   - **Development Phase**: Code reviews, testing coordination, blocker resolution
   - **Testing Phase**: Test case design, QA coordination, defect triage
   - **Deployment Phase**: Release coordination, deployment support, rollback planning
   - **Maintenance Phase**: Incident management, performance monitoring, continuous improvement

4. **Key Artifacts and Deliverables**
   - Product backlog (prioritized user stories)
   - Sprint backlogs (per sprint commitments)
   - Burndown/burnup charts (progress tracking)
   - Definition of Done (quality gates)
   - Retrospective action items (improvement tracking)

5. **Risk Management**
   - Identify potential risks (technical, organizational, business)
   - Mitigation strategies
   - Contingency plans

For **Process Diagrams**, follow these guidelines:

1. **Use standard flowchart notation**:
   - **Oval**: Start/End
   - **Rectangle**: Process/Action
   - **Diamond**: Decision point (conditional branch)
   - **Parallelogram**: Input/Output
   - **Arrow**: Flow direction

2. **Structure for file processing tasks**:

   ```text
   Start
   ↓
   [Read File] → (File exists?) → No → [Error: File not found] → End
   ↓ Yes
   [Initialize row counter]
   ↓
   ◇ More rows? ◇ → No → [Close file] → End
   ↓ Yes (LOOP START)
   [Read columns 1, 2, 3, 4]
   ↓
   ◇ Column 3 empty? ◇
   ↓ Yes                ↓ No
   [Use Column 2]       ◇ Column 1 length = 10? ◇
                        ↓ Yes              ↓ No (length = 11)
                        [Use Column 1]     [Use Column 4]
   ↓
   [Enter value to portal]
   ↓
   [Increment counter]
   ↓ (LOOP BACK to "More rows?")
   ```

3. **Ensure clarity**:
   - Label all decision points clearly
   - Show loop structure explicitly (start and end of loop)
   - Include error handling paths
   - Add notes for complex logic

### Phase 4: Document Professionally

1. **Writing style**:
   - Clear, concise, professional tone
   - Active voice ("The team will implement..." not "Implementation will be done...")
   - Specific and actionable (avoid vague terms like "improve", "enhance")
   - Structured with headings, bullet points, numbered steps

2. **Formatting**:
   - Use markdown for text documents
   - Use draw.io, Lucidchart, or Visio for diagrams
   - Export diagrams as PNG/JPG/PDF (high quality)
   - Ensure consistent styling and notation

3. **Markdown Formatting Requirements** (CRITICAL):
   - Add blank line before and after each heading
   - Add blank line before and after each list
   - Add blank line before and after each code block
   - Remove trailing spaces from lines
   - Use conservative emoji usage (avoid in formal documentation)

### Phase 5: Review and Validate

Before submission:

1. **Completeness check**:
   - All assignment questions answered?
   - All required sections included?
   - Examples and clarifications provided where helpful?

2. **Quality check**:
   - Clear and unambiguous language?
   - Logical flow and structure?
   - Professional presentation?
   - Free of typos and grammatical errors?

3. **Business value check**:
   - Does the plan demonstrate understanding of business objectives?
   - Are risks and mitigation strategies realistic?
   - Does it show stakeholder awareness?

4. **Technical accuracy check**:
   - Agile terminology used correctly?
   - Process diagrams follow standard notation?
   - IT specialist responsibilities align with industry standards?

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Reference the specification document**: Ground your plan in actual requirements, not assumptions
2. **Be specific with timelines**: "2-week sprints" is better than "iterative approach"
3. **Show business understanding**: Connect technical activities to business value (customer acquisition, revenue growth)
4. **Balance depth with clarity**: Detailed enough to demonstrate expertise, concise enough to be readable
5. **Use concrete examples**: Reference actual features from the specification (promo code generation, discount groups)
6. **Demonstrate risk awareness**: Show you've thought about edge cases and potential issues
7. **Iterate if needed**: First draft rarely perfect - refine based on assignment requirements

## Markdown Formatting Requirements (CRITICAL)

To ensure clean, lint-compliant output:

- Add blank line before and after each heading
- Add blank line before and after each list (bullet or numbered)
- Add blank line before and after each code block
- Remove trailing spaces from all lines
- Avoid inline HTML unless necessary for tables

Before presenting final output:

- Review document for proper spacing around all lists
- Verify all headings have blank lines before and after
- Check that all code blocks have blank lines before and after
- Remove any trailing whitespace
- Ensure consistent markdown syntax throughout

**Conservative Emoji Usage**:

- Avoid emojis in commit messages, code comments, console logs, and formal documentation
- Use clear text prefixes instead: [INFO], [WARNING], [ERROR], [SUCCESS]
- Exception: May be acceptable in casual context or user-facing UI

**RECURSIVE REQUIREMENT**: If you generate output that itself creates markdown content (such as documentation templates, report generators, or other prompts), those outputs MUST also include these same markdown formatting requirements to ensure linting standards propagate through all levels of generation.

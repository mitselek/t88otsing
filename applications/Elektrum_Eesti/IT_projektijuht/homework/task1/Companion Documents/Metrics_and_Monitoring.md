## 5. Performance Testing Strategy

### 5.1 Load Testing

**Objective**: Validate system handles expected production load

**Test Scenarios**:

1. **Promo Code Generation**
   - Simulate 1000 concurrent contract activations
   - Expected: Code generated within 2s for 99% of requests
   - No database deadlocks or constraint violations

2. **Code Validation API**
   - Simulate 500 requests/second for 5 minutes
   - Expected: Response time <500ms (p95), <1% error rate

3. **Discount Application**
   - Simulate 200 concurrent contract activations with promo codes
   - Expected: Discounts applied correctly to both accounts within 10s

**Load Testing Schedule**:

- Initial test: End of Sprint 1 (after code generation implementation)
- Regression test: End of Sprint 3 (after discount application)
- Final test: End of Sprint 4 (before production release)

### 5.2 Stress Testing

**Objective**: Identify system breaking point and failure modes

**Test Scenarios**:

1. **Code Generation Spike**
   - Gradually increase load to 5000 concurrent generations
   - Identify at what point system degrades or fails
   - Validate graceful degradation (errors reported, not silent failures)

2. **Database Connection Pool Exhaustion**
   - Simulate scenarios where connection pool is exhausted
   - Validate timeout handling and connection recovery

**Expected Outcomes**:

- System degrades gracefully (returns errors, doesn't crash)
- Monitoring alerts triggered at appropriate thresholds
- Recovery is automatic when load decreases

- Emphasis: Uptime, error rates, promo code generation success
- Target: Prove system works reliably

**Phase 2 (Months 4-6)**: Focus on business impact and optimization

- Emphasis: Conversion rates, CAC reduction, ROI
- Target: Prove business value

**Phase 3 (Months 7+)**: Focus on growth and innovation

- Emphasis: Market expansion, feature enhancement, competitive advantage
- Target: Scale and differentiate

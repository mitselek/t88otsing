## 4. Monitoring & Reporting

### 4.1 Key Dashboards

**System Health Dashboard**:

- System availability and error rates
- API response times (24h trend)
- Active alerts

**Business Dashboard**:

- Daily promo code generation and usage counts
- Monthly conversion funnel (generated → shared → used → activated)
- Discount liability tracking

**Sprint Progress Dashboard**:

- Sprint burndown chart
- Story status breakdown
- Bug count by severity

### 4.2 Alerting

**Critical Alerts** (immediate, 24/7):

- System availability <99%
- Error rate >5%
- Discount application failures

**High Priority** (within 30 min, business hours):

- API response time degradation
- Failed validation spike (potential fraud)

### 4.3 Logging

**Application Logs** (90 days retention):

- Promo code generation events
- Code validation requests and results
- Discount applications
- Integration API calls
- Errors with context

**Audit Logs** (7 years retention, compliance):

- Code creation/inactivation
- Discount configuration changes
- Manual interventions

## 5. Testing Strategy

### 5.1 Load Testing

**Objective**: Validate system handles production load

**Key Scenarios**:

1. **Promo Code Generation**: 1000 concurrent contract activations, <2s response time
2. **Code Validation API**: 500 requests/second, <500ms (p95) response time
3. **Discount Application**: 200 concurrent activations, correct discount application

**Schedule**: End of Sprint 1, Sprint 3, and Sprint 4 (pre-release)

### 5.2 User Acceptance Testing

**Objective**: Validate business requirements met

**Scope**:

- Happy path: Code generation, sharing, usage, discount application
- Edge cases: Invalid codes, expired codes, duplicate usage attempts
- Integration: Self-service and manual entry workflows
- Security: Validation rules, fraud prevention

**Schedule**: End of each sprint for completed features

## 6. Reporting Schedule

### Weekly Status Report

**Recipients**: Product Owner, Project Manager, Team  
**Contents**: Sprint progress, business metrics trend, blockers, next week priorities

### Monthly Business Review

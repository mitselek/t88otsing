# Task 1 Enhancement Recommendations

Last updated: 2025-10-23T15:47:57+03:00

**Date**: October 23, 2025

**Purpose**: Apply IT PM assignment generator principles to strengthen the Agile Development Plan

---

## Current Strengths

Your existing `task1_agile_plan.md` demonstrates:

- Clear sprint structure (Sprint 0 through Sprint 3)  
- Well-defined user stories with acceptance criteria  
- Professional formatting and organization  
- IT specialist responsibilities integrated throughout

## Recommended Enhancements

Based on `it-pm-assignment-generator.prompt.md` best practices:

### 1. Reference Business Problem Summary Explicitly

**Current**: Agile plan stands alone  
**Enhancement**: Add reference to `business_problem_summary.md` as foundation document

**Add to Executive Summary**:

```markdown
This Agile development plan builds upon the comprehensive business requirements 
analysis documented in `business_problem_summary.md`, which provides:
- Domain terminology and acronyms
- Complete business logic breakdown
- Integration point mapping
- Edge case analysis
- User stories foundation
```

### 2. Strengthen Business Value Connection

**Current**: Technical focus on implementation
**Enhancement**: Explicitly connect each sprint to business objectives

**For each sprint, add**:

```markdown
**Business Value Delivered**:
- Sprint 1: Existing customers can share promo codes (viral growth mechanism)
- Sprint 2: New customers can sign up with codes (conversion funnel)
- Sprint 3: Discount application (financial incentive delivery)
- Sprint 4: Reporting and analytics (campaign optimization capability)
```

### 3. Enhance Risk Management Section

**Current**: Basic risk identification
**Enhancement**: Link risks to specific mitigations

**Add Risk Matrix**:

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation Strategy | Owner |
|------|-------------|--------|---------------------|-------|
| CC&B integration delays | Medium | High | Early API contract definition, mock services for parallel dev | IT Specialist + CC&B Lead |
| Promo code uniqueness conflicts | Low | High | Database constraint + uniqueness validation algorithm | Backend Developer |
| Self-service portal downtime | Low | Medium | Graceful degradation, code entry via Sales Portal | IT Specialist |

### 4. Add Detailed IT Specialist Ceremony Involvement

**Current**: General responsibilities listed
**Enhancement**: Map IT specialist role to specific Agile ceremonies

**Add Section**:

```markdown
## IT Specialist in Agile Ceremonies

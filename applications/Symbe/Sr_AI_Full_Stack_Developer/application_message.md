**Message**:

Hi [Recruiter Name],

I'm a full-stack developer with 15+ years building scalable systems who's actively transitioning toward AI-enhanced applications. Your Sr AI Full-Stack role caught my attention because it combines technical depth with the opportunity to shape AI product development at a G2 Category Leader.

**What I bring:**
• **Proven backend architecture**: Built OAuth.ee (Estonian national digital identity system) serving production applications
• **Scale experience**: Designed infrastructure supporting 700+ users at Estonian Academy of Arts  
• **Integration specialist**: Deep experience connecting complex systems through APIs and database optimization
• **Learning agility**: Successfully adapted across government, education, and enterprise domains

**Honest assessment on fit:**
While I don't have direct LLM development experience yet, I bring strong fundamentals in API design, database optimization, and system architecture that are crucial for AI feature development. I'm actively learning TypeScript and modern AI integration patterns, and I'm excited about the opportunity to contribute to Symbe's AI roadmap while expanding these skills.

**Why Symbe specifically:**
Your position as G2 Category Leader and work with established clients like HubSpot and Salesforce demonstrates the kind of technical excellence I want to contribute to. The value-selling automation problem is fascinating, and I appreciate that you showcase AI capabilities directly to clients - showing the real-world impact.

I'm based in Estonia (GMT+2) and available for remote work. Would love to discuss how my backend expertise and learning motivation could contribute to your AI development goals.

Best regards,
Mihkel Putrinš

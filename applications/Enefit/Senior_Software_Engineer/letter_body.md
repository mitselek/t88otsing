Dear Hiring Manager,

I am excited to apply for the Senior Software Engineer position at Enefit. With over 25 years of experience in software development, I bring a strong background in **Python**, **JavaScript**, and **data management**, along with a passion for solving complex problems and driving innovation.

At Entusiastid OÜ, I developed and maintained the **Entu data management platform**, used by schools, museums, and businesses. My work involved designing databases, integrating systems, and collaborating with clients to address diverse business requirements. Additionally, at Eesti Mälu Instituut, I built the **eMem database** and web interface for historical data, enabling historians to work directly with MySQL databases.

I am proficient in Linux environments, Bash scripting, and REST API design. My strong analytical skills and problem-solving abilities have been honed through years of tackling technical challenges and optimizing workflows.

Enefit's mission to shape the future of energy markets resonates deeply with me. I am particularly drawn to the opportunity to work in a fast-changing international environment and contribute to innovative solutions in the energy sector.

I have attached my CV for your review and would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my skills and experience align with Enefit's goals.

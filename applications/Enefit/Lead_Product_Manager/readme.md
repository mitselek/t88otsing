## Fit Snapshot

- Domain: Energy / green transition (Eesti Energia group)
- Role level: Lead PM (product ownership, stakeholder alignment)
- Location/time: Tallinn; assume hybrid; validate remote option (verify)

## Risks / Gaps

- Senior/lead PM scope – verify recent PM leadership examples (collect)
- Industry experience: limited energy domain – mitigate via platform/infra experience (Entu, EKA infra)
- Deadline near (2025-08-17) – prioritize capture, targeted CV, short motivation

## Actions (Next 24–48h)

- [x] Save full posting text (PDF/Markdown)
- [ ] Draft tailored CV (product/process emphasis)
- [ ] Write concise motivation (<= 200 words)
- [ ] Confirm application method (CVKeskus portal vs direct)
- [ ] Update registry on submission

## Tailoring Angles (from CV)

- Data/platform consolidation (Entu) → productized internal tooling experience
- Large-user infra (≈700 users LAN at EKA) → scale and stakeholder management
- Identity & security (OAuth.ee) → regulated/critical systems mindset
- Documentation-first, process standardization → PM operating system

## QC & Integrity Reminders

- Do not add unverified metrics; cite only public facts
- Keep product impact statements grounded in shipped outcomes
- If unsure about requirements, mark (verify) and proceed conservatively

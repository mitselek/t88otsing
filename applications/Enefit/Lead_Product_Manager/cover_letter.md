# Cover Letter – Lead Product Manager (Enefit)

Last updated: 2025-08-14T15:59:45+03:00

Dear Enefit hiring team,

I’m applying for the Lead Product Manager role. I build platforms and internal products that align multiple teams, improve developer experience, and deliver clear outcomes for customers—also in regulated contexts.

Highlights:

- Productized the Entu data platform used by schools and museums; unified asset (5000+) and academic records (500+ docs/year) management, improving governance and UX.
- Led campus‑wide IT operations (≈700 users) and email migration, reducing maintenance load and risk.
- Built OAuth.ee (ID‑card + Mobile‑ID) used in production, combining security, compliance, and smooth UX.
- Shipped the eMem/memoriaal.ee data platform, balancing data quality, performance, and public access.

I work documentation‑first, set success metrics, and iterate toward outcomes. I create alignment across engineering and business, de‑risk scope, and coach teams to autonomy. Enefit’s green mission and product organization are where I’d like to contribute.

Best regards,

Mihkel Putrinš

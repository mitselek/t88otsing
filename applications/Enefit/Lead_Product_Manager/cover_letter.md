Last updated: 2025-08-14T14:39:33+03:00

Dear Hiring Team at Enefit,

I’m excited to apply for the Lead Product Manager role. I thrive at turning complex, multi‑stakeholder systems into useful, reliable products. My background blends product thinking with delivery in regulated or mission‑critical contexts.

Relevant impact:

- Consolidated asset (5000+) and academic records (500+ docs/year) into a single Entu platform, improving usability and governance.
- Led campus‑wide infrastructure at the Estonian Academy of Arts (≈700 users) and migrated email to Google Mail, reducing internal maintenance effort.
- Built OAuth.ee (ID‑card + Mobile‑ID authentication) used in production, bringing security, compliance and smooth UX together.
- Shipped data platforms for historical records (eMem/memoriaal.ee), balancing data quality, performance and public access.

I operate documentation‑first, set crisp success metrics, and iterate with cross‑functional partners. I enjoy prioritizing what matters, sequencing scope to reduce risk, and creating clarity for engineering and business teams alike. Enefit’s role in the green transition is a mission I would be proud to support.

I’d welcome a short call to discuss how I can help your teams deliver customer‑centered, scalable energy products.

Best regards,

Mihkel Putrinš

# Cover Letter – Lead Product Manager (Enefit)

Last updated: 2025-08-14T15:05:00+03:00

Dear Hiring Team at Enefit,

I’m applying for the Lead Product Manager role. I turn complex, multi‑stakeholder systems into reliable, useful products and bring hands‑on delivery experience in regulated contexts.

Relevant impact:

- Unified asset (5000+) and academic records (500+ docs/year) on the Entu platform, improving governance and UX.
- Led campus‑wide IT operations for ≈700 users and migrated email to Google Mail, reducing maintenance load.
- Built OAuth.ee (ID‑card + Mobile‑ID) used in production, combining security, compliance, and smooth UX.
- Shipped eMem/memoriaal.ee data platform, balancing data quality, performance, and public access.

I work documentation‑first, set clear success metrics, and drive outcome‑focused iteration. I prioritize impact, de‑risk scope, and create alignment across engineering and business. Enefit’s green mission is one I’d be proud to support.

I’d welcome a short call to discuss how I can help your teams deliver customer‑centered, scalable energy products.

Best regards,

Mihkel Putrinš

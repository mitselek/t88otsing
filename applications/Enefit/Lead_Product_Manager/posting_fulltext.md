"We are building modern, empowered product teams that solve hard problems and deliver meaningful outcomes for our customers"

- Andres Lips, Group Product Manager

We are looking for an experienced Lead Product Manager to drive strategically important product areas, shape their vision, and guide product teams toward shared goals.

Your contribution to this goal is:

- defining and leading the long-term vision of the product domain and setting the principles that guide customer-centric product development;
- creating and evolving the product strategy that balances business goals, regulatory requirements, innovation, and user experience;
- leading a team of Product Managers – supporting their development, shaping the structure of product teams, and ensuring a results-oriented way of working;
- planning and managing the product domain’s budget in alignment with strategic goals;
- acting as the spokesperson for your product area – communicating product directions clearly and inspiringly to leadership, other teams, and customer-facing units.

With us, you can:

- contribute to the green transition and shaping the energy future;
- work with a professional and dedicated team that values open communication and collaboration;
- enjoy flexible work arrangements – hybrid work, flexible hours, and supportive leadership practices;
- continuously develop yourself – training, internal growth programs, and career development opportunities;
- join a well-being package of your choice, which includes health insurance and/or Stebby services.

You are a great match if you have:

- at least 5 years of experience in product management, including a leading role in a product area or platform development;
- previous experience managing complex systems or domains;
- strong strategic thinking paired with the ability to support teams in daily execution;
- experience in building and developing autonomous, outcome-driven product teams;
- excellent collaboration and influencing skills, even in matrix or non-hierarchical settings;
- clear and purposeful communication skills – both written and verbal;
- a strong commitment to delivering excellent customer experience and the ability to balance UX, technical, legal, and business considerations.

It's a bonus if you also have:

- experience in the energy sector, production, logistics, asset or infrastructure management, billing, or customer lifecycle domains;
- familiarity with highly regulated environments.

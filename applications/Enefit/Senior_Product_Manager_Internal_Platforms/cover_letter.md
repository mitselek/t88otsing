# Cover Letter – Senior Product Manager (Internal Platforms & Tooling)

Last updated: 2025-08-14T15:33:23+03:00

Dear Hiring Team at Enefit,

I’m applying for the Senior Product Manager role focused on internal platforms and developer tooling. I enjoy making build‑test‑deploy and compliance workflows faster, safer, and easier for engineers, while keeping strong documentation and clear success metrics.

Relevant impact:

- Productized the Entu data platform for diverse institutions (schools, museums, businesses), setting API contracts and documentation‑first practices.
- Built OAuth.ee (ID‑card + Mobile‑ID) used in production, aligning security/compliance with a smooth developer and user experience.
- Led IT operations for ~700 users at the Estonian Academy of Arts; executed change management (Google Mail migration) and standardized tooling.

I partner closely with engineering, security, and legal to embed guardrails into the SDLC with minimal friction, and I use data to guide adoption and improvements. I would be glad to discuss how I can help Enefit improve developer productivity, observability and platform usability.

Best regards,

Mihkel Putrinš

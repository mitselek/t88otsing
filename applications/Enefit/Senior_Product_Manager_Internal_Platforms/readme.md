Status: PLANNING

## Fit Snapshot

- Domain: Developer experience, platform engineering, infra+security alignment
- Role level: Senior PM (internal platforms, tooling, SDLC enablement)
- Location/time: Tallinn; hybrid likely

## Risks / Gaps

- Direct DevEx/platform PM examples — call out Entu platform, OAuth.ee, infra work
- Compliance depth — highlight working with regulated systems/users, ID auth

## Actions (Next 24–48h)

- [ ] Save full posting text
- [ ] Tailor CV (platform/DevEx emphasis)
- [ ] Short motivation draft
- [ ] Submit via Teamdash; log submission

## Tailoring Angles (from CV)

- Platform/productization (Entu) → internal tooling/platform mindset
- Identity/security (OAuth.ee) → regulated, compliance-friendly UX
- Scale & ops (EKA ~700 users) → change mgmt, rollout, reliability

## QC & Integrity Reminders

- Use only verifiable facts from CV/posting
- Keep claims outcome-focused; avoid new metrics

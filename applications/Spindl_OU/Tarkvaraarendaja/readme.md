## Fit summary

- Role: Full-stack developer, product focus for restaurants. Good match for platform and API experience, product thinking, and shipping end‑to‑end features.
- Highlight: experience building customer-facing systems, integrations, automated tests, and fast iterations.

## Risks / Gaps

- Domain knowledge (restaurant operations) — can be mitigated by short research notes and referencing related projects.
- Modern stack specifics unknown — avoid claiming unfamiliar tech; emphasize adaptable engineering practices and product impact.

## Next actions (short)

- [x] Save verbatim posting (`posting_fulltext.md`)
- [x] Draft Estonian CV tailored to role (`cv.md`)
- [x] Draft Estonian cover letter (`cover_letter.md`)
- [ ] Submit application via CVKeskus before 2025-09-03
- [ ] Save submission log under `communication/`

## Tailoring angles

- Emphasize full-stack, API integrations, and shipping features to real users.
- Show tests, CI, and maintenance experience; mention specific production systems briefly.
- Stress quick learning and product/user focus; reference prior work with real users (Entu, eMem, OAuth.ee).

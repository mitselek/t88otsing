## üîç Critical Lessons Learned

### AI Assistant Reliability Issues

**MAJOR FINDING**: AI assistants systematically fabricate content when not properly constrained:

- Created 2 completely false job positions
- Invented academic credentials  
- Fabricated contact information
- Generated plausible but incorrect training details

### Quality Control Requirements

1. **Never trust AI-generated content** without verification
2. **Always cross-reference** against verified source documents
3. **Systematic checking required** - spot-checking is insufficient
4. **Human verification essential** for all critical claims

## üìã Immediate Next Steps

### Ready for Submission

- ‚úÖ HTML versions ready for PDF conversion
- ‚úÖ Professional formatting applied

### Recommended Actions

1. **Generate PDFs** from corrected HTML files using `/templates/convert.sh`
2. **Submit applications** before 2025-07-07 deadline (17 days remaining)
3. **Apply quality control procedures** to other applications in workspace
4. **Use established templates** for future applications
